# Flutter Projects

Welcome to my repository dedicated to my **Flutter** projects.  
Here you’ll find apps I’ve built for learning, experimentation, and personal development.

---

## nosso_primeiro_projeto
> A project developed as part of the **“Formação Flutter | Alura”** course.

An introductory app built while learning the fundamentals of Flutter development — exploring widgets, layouts, and app structure.

---

## compendium
> A personal app for **Dungeons & Dragons** players.

This app lists D&D spells, helping me practice Flutter concepts like state management, API consumption, and UI building while following official Flutter documentation.

---

## Truques de Rhion Farynore
> A reading app for **level 0 D&D spells**.

A small but fun project designed to display and explore cantrips (basic spells) from Dungeons & Dragons, combining my interests in fantasy and programming.
